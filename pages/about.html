                    <p>Hello, I'm Osman Karapinar, the administrator of Sneakerz. I'm 17 years old and currently studying Software Development at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam. I'm bilingual and speak both Dutch and Turkish. My passion for sneakers has been a part of me since I was young. As I grew older, I began building my own collection, using my own pocket money and income from my part-time job at Kruidvat, a Dutch drugstore. I'm dedicated to providing the best sneaker experience for our customers.</p>
